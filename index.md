<!--- # Custom Object Detection
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! --->

<h2> Milestone 2 </h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/84xeKC2HaYY" title="Kallesh A. Second Milestone" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4> Techincal Details</h4>
Since my previous milestone I have added a camera and the specific camera I added is the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. Then I had to test this camera with the code “libcamera-hello -t 0”. This line of code is entered into the terminal on the Pi and it causes the camera to turn on for an indefinite amount of time and you can turn of the camera by pressing “ctr C” in the same terminal as the run command.  The camera contributes to the final goal as it is fundamental for the object detection and can’t be done without it.

<h4> Challenges and Suprises</h4>

The thing that was surprising about the project was that I thought it would be more challenging but everything seems to be running smooth for the most part. But I think I will face some issues as for the 3rd milestone it will be more coding intensive and I can run into some issues there. Previous challenges I faced was the Adafruit BrainCraft HAT not working so I decided to use my monitor instead as it would be easier and higher resolution and overall easier to use. 

<h4> Future Plans </h4> 
Some things that need to be completed before my final milestone are that I need to get the code for the actual object detection and get it working and set up the data set and do some AI training on parts to get it working properly. 



<h2>Milestone 1</h2>

<h4> Summary </h4>
My project is a custom object detection system. It uses TensorFlow Lite with a Raspberry Pi 4 and the BrainCraft HAT. It will be able to detect and recognize specific objects and has many real life uses such as it can be used in robotics and security systems. The main components needed for this project are a Raspberry Pi and it runs software to process data. The Adafruit BrainCraft HAT, is connected to the Raspberry Pi and provides a display or you can use a monitor instead with I have done. A keyboard and mouse to control the Raspberry Pi. And along with that to capture video I am using a  Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. This video can be shown on both the Adafruit HAT or a laptop/monitor. The laptop uses OBS and manages the video output by the camera. And you would need a power supply to supply the entire project and allow it to run. Progress I have made so far is that I have attached all my hardware together and updated my Pi and have it all set up for my next milestones. 

<h4> Challenges Faced </h4>
Challenges I am facing was getting n to output through the BrainCraft HAT when the monitor was working along with it so to bypass this I am just going to use the computer screen through OBS as I have a bigger screen and better resolution this way and is easier to work with the rest of the project is working smoothly with no issues. 


<h4> Future Plans </h4>
My plan to complete my project is to first test all my compnents so next I will test my camera and fix issues if there are any and then after that do milestone 2 wich would be getting a working camera and then finally run the code and get the entire project working wich would be my milestone 3 and finally work on my modifications.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

<h3>Starter Project</h3> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fD4Bt4kgAtw" title="Kallesh A. Starter Project" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4>Summary</h4>

My starter project was a retro arcade game. It is a handheld game with includes five classic retro games: Tetris, Snakes, Racing Cars, Space Invaders, and Slots Machine. It is a fun and educational journey as you have to build it yourself. It is a great project once completed to use with family and friends. It is easy to assemble as the instructions are very straight forward. Its main features are six large buttons with rounded acrylic case corners for a comfortable user experience. The game’s working voltage is DC 3.5-5.5V. You can play games with a power bank, 5v power adapter or 3 AAA batteries.

<h4>Challenges Faced</h4>

Some challenges I faced was that I was missing a screw wich caused some difficulty and had to position my other screws in a way to keep it as stable as possible and also my lack of soldering caused the timer at the top to be placed in tilted and since I put too much solder it was extremely hard to remove the solder but it still worked overall.

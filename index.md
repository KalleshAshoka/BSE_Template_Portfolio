<!--- # Custom Object Detection
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! --->

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fD4Bt4kgAtw" title="Kallesh A. Starter Project" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3>Summary</h3>

My starter project was a retro arcade game. It is a handheld game with includes five classic retro games: Tetris, Snakes, Racing Cars, Space Invaders, and Slots Machine. It is a fun and educational journey as you have to build it yourself. It is a great project once completed to use with family and friends. It is easy to assemble as the instructions are very straight forward. Its main features are six large buttons with rounded acrylic case corners for a comfortable user experience. The gameâ€™s working voltage is DC 3.5-5.5V. You can play games with a power bank, 5v power adapter or 3 AAA batteries.

<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>

Some challenges I faced was that I was missing a screw wich caused some difficulty and had to position my other screws in a way to keep it as stable as possible and also my lack of soldering caused the timer at the top to be placed in tilted and since I put too much solder it was extremely hard to remove the solder but it still worked overall.
